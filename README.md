# Automated Trading System with Quantitative Strategies

This project aims to build a fully automated trading system using Python, incorporating quantitative trading strategies based on the postmodern portfolio theory. Additionally, the system will utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for machine learning predictions on time series data to enhance trading decisions.

## Features

- Postmodern Portfolio Theory: Implementing quantitative strategies based on the postmodern portfolio theory to optimize portfolio performance.
- Automated Trading: Developing a system that can automatically execute trades based on predefined rules and strategies.
- Recurrent Neural Networks: Utilizing RNNs for machine learning predictions on time series data to improve trading decisions.
- Risk Management: Implementing robust risk management techniques to mitigate potential losses.
- Data Analysis: Performing in-depth data analysis to identify profitable trading opportunities.
- Performance Monitoring: Monitoring the performance of the trading system and strategies to make necessary adjustments.
- Reporting: Generating reports to evaluate the effectiveness of the trading strategies and overall system performance.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/automated-trading-system.git
```

## Install the required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up your API keys for trading platforms (if applicable) and configure the system according to your preferences.

## Usage

Run the main script to start the automated trading system:
